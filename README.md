# Taylor Approximation

The following app is based on Taylor Approximation and is built using ```Streamlit```

Given a function, $n^{th}$ degree taylor approximation can be done about point ```a``` (variable).

A degree n can be chosen using slider from 1 to n. (Max value of n is 10)

The app for Taylor approximation of arbitary function about any point can be acceded [here](https://saikrishna4276-taylor-approximation-taylor-arbitaryfn-jke7ay.streamlit.app/)
